      <p class="about-me">
        I'm Raihan Ahmad. I have completed the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I
        invested 700+ hours to learn and work. It is a great experience in my
        life. Before the #100DaysOfCod, I had no experience with web
        development. Now I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, GitHub, and
        so on. And made some really cool web projects. Thanks to everyone who
        liked, commented, and support on my daily updates on Twitter.
